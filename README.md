# DisableLegacyInventory

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that disables the legacy inventory gesture, but it has a config option that can enable it again.
This also does not disable the CTRL + I keybind to open the legacy inventory, so you can use a virtual multi key with that combo to open it as well.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [DisableLegacyInventory.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/DisableLegacyInventory/releases/latest/download/DisableLegacyInventory.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
